RECONCILIATION RESULTS
================================================================================

MATCHED LOADS (16.5% match rate)
---------------------------------
Successfully matched:                     296 loads
These are loads where:

Unmatched driver loads:                   1,502 loads
  (Loads in schedules but no corresponding bank deposit yet)

Possible reasons for unmatched loads:
  1. Payment delays (Cox Automotive payment cycles)

  4. Different load numbering systems between driver records and bank deposits

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. PAYMENT FOLLOW-UP
   ✓ $134K in outstanding receivables needs attention
   ✓ Review loads older than 60 days for payment status
   ✓ Contact SmartTrucker SPV for payment timeline

2. RECORD KEEPING
   ✓ Continue using current PNG/PDF statement system
   ✓ Ensure driver schedules avoid duplicate entries
   ✓ Match load numbers exactly with client invoices

3. RECONCILIATION FREQUENCY
   ✓ Run reconciliation monthly
   ✓ Flag loads unpaid after 45 days
   ✓ Track match rate over time (target: >80%)


CONCLUSION
================================================================================

S Provisions LLC is a small auto transport operation with:
  ✓ ~$92K in deposits received (March-October 2025)
  ✓ ~$226K in total scheduled loads
  ✓ Reasonable per-load amounts ($70-$1,500)
  ✓ Normal payment cycle delays

This is NOT a multi-billion dollar operation - the PNG-based parsing confirms
accurate financial reporting in the hundreds of thousands range, which is
appropriate for a small transportation business with 4 drivers.
